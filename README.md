# Seal_Image_Classification

## Files

### "src/"

The "src/" directory contains the python codes for the seal image classification.

### "output/"

Inside the "output/" directory, you could see 2 directories - "binary" and "multi".
The "binary" directory contains the result of the binary classification, which trained with PCA(n=39).
Similarly, in the "multi" directory contains the result of the multi-class classification, which trained with PCA(n=39).
For both binary and multi-class classification, the XGBClassifier is used.

### "image/"

The "image/" directory contains the generated images (i.e. heatmap of confusion matrix).

### "result"

This directory contains the csv files that are generated by running the main.py file (PCA with n = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35,40]).
